# MEAN Angular 2 Authentication

This project is a Work in Progress for handle basic authentication in a MEAN project.

You can signup and signin, the account is registered in a mongoDB collection.

## Technologies used
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
* [Angular 2](https://angular.io/)
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Others technologies used:
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Angular2-jwt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular2-jwt)
* [Passport](http://passportjs.org/)
* [Bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt)
* [Validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validator)

### Run
You need MongoDB and Node.js installed to run this project.

1. `mongod`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`
4. Go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

The server will auto restart on changes, but you still need to refresh your browser.

## How to use
You can create an account in the signup page, then you can loggin in the signin page. The accounts are registered in a mongoDB collection (mean-angular2-authentication). An account requires email and password. The password is crypted in the collection.

If you are logged, the private page show you your email, if not, it show you a different message.

#### Thanks and links
I started with the [DavideViolante's project](https://github.com/DavideViolante/Angular2-Express-Mongoose), and I added the authentication system.

Two tutorials helped me a lot:

* [http://youknowriad.github.io/angular2-cookbooks/stateless-authentication.html](http://youknowriad.github.io/angular2-cookbooks/stateless-authentication.html)

Thanks for their help.
